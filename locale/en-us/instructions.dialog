This is how you play supersmart blockhead. I'll ask you a question and you have to answer immediately after the beep. Do not think about the question too much. If you're not answering after a few seconds, I'll repeat the question once and then hang on to the next question. I wish you best of luck and lots of fun. Cheers. Let's start.
